+ Hi George,
I’m sorry to hear about your problems with your family. I usually get on really well with my parents, although we don’t agree about everything and we sometimes have arguments.

I think you should avoid having serious discussions with your dad if you never agree.
Little sisters can be difficult, but just be patient. I’m sure you’ll get on better when she grows up. Take care and write soon,

My performance went well, and I was pleased that I had done my best, I didn’t win the show, but I will always be pleased that I took part!

- Your teacher has asked you to write a story. This is the title for your story: A new home Write your story?

Last month, I went to visit my brother in his new flat. He has moved in a week before and had invited me for dinner.
When I arrived at the large apartment building, I rang the bell of the flat on the third floor, but no one answered. First, I thought he was out, so I decided to wait. Then, after an hour, I began to get check his address. I couldn’t believe it- he lived on the fourth floor! I went upstairs immediately. Luckily, my brother and his flatmates found it funny, and we enjoyed a lovely dinner together.

- This is part of a letter you receive from an english friend • I enjoy my new job but I sit at a computer all day now. I don’t get much exercise. What do you think I should do to keep fit?
+ Dear Teresa,
Thanks you for your letter. I am pleased to hear that you have a new job.
Congratulation!
Working with a computer all day long make you tired and don’t have time to get much exercise. In order to tackle this problem, I would strongly recommend that you should take part in a gym or sports club as a member at weekends. When you have to pay fee for that activity, you will have more motivation to keep fit. Furthermore, it is good way to limit the amount of fast food you eat. Eating healthy food makes you stronger and stay away from disease.
Anyway, that’s all for now because I’ve got to go out.
Take care and write soon!
 Love, Hoan/Duc

- This is part of a letter you recive from a friend • I can’t decide whether to buy a new bicycle from a shop or on the Internet,
+ Dear Alex,
Thanks you for your letter. I am delighted to hear that you won a prize in a competition. Congratulation! Regarding the questions you asked me about whether you should buy a new bike from shop or on the Internet. I have to say that you should go to a shop to opt because it is easy to check before taking it home. what’s more? Warranty process is also better as it doesn’t take so long to transport the bike if it has any problems. Take me as one example, I buy clothes on the internet, but I am not pleased with the items I receive. It is so different compared to images on the internet. Anyway, that’s all for now because I’ve got to go out.
Take care and write soon!
Love,

I am very happy for this.
